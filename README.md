## About this Specialization
This five-week, accelerated online specialization provides participants a hands-on introduction to designing and building data processing systems on Google Cloud Platform. Through a combination of presentations, demos, and hand-on labs, participants will learn how to design data processing systems, build end-to-end data pipelines, analyze data and carry out machine learning. The course covers structured, unstructured, and streaming data.

##### This course teaches the following skills:

• Design and build data processing systems on Google Cloud Platform

• Leverage unstructured data using Spark and ML APIs on Cloud Dataproc

• Process batch and streaming data by implementing autoscaling data pipelines on Cloud Dataflow

• Derive business insights from extremely large datasets using Google BigQuery

• Train, evaluate and predict using machine learning models using Tensorflow and Cloud ML

• Enable instant insights from streaming data

This class is intended for developers who are responsible for:

• Extracting, Loading, Transforming, cleaning, and validating data

• Designing pipelines and architectures for data processing

• Creating and maintaining machine learning and statistical models

• Querying datasets, visualizing query results and creating reports
